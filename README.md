# Make Believe 


Make believe is a project to develop a machine learning solution to detect long-form fake news through the use of psycholinguistic, coherence and readibility scores, calculated with [lftk](https://github.com/brucewlee/lftk/blob/main/readme.md#essential-tips-and-to-do-guides). The dataset used to train and evaluate the model can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassanamin/textdb3).
